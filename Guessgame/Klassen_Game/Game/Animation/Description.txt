Abundant Numbers:

Description:
Abundant numbers (also known as excessive numbers) are numbers where 
the sum of their proper divisors is greater than the number itself.

Mathematics:
For a given number n, let σ (n) be the sum of its proper divisors.
If σ (n) > n, then n is an abundant number.

Example:
Consider the number 12. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
σ (12) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16
Since σ (12) = 16 > 12, 12 is an abundant number.

Automorphic Numbers:

Description:
Automorphic numbers are numbers whose square ends with the same digits as the number itself.

Mathematics:
For a given number n, it is automorphic if the last digits of n^2 are the same as n.

Example:
The number 5 is automorphic, because 5^2 = 25, and the square ends with 5.
The number 76 is also automorphic, as 76^2 = 5776, and the square ends with 76.

Bell Numbers:

Description:
Bell numbers represent the number of different ways a set of n elements can be partitioned. 
These numbers are named after the mathematician Eric Temple Bell.

Mathematics:
To generate a Bell number, one uses the Bell Triangle.
The key rules for the triangle are:
1. The first number in row i is the last number in row i-1.
2. Each subsequent number in row i is the sum of the previous number in the same row and the number directly above it.

The Bell number for a given number n is the last entry in the n-th row of this triangle.

Example:
Consider the set {1, 2, 3}. The different partitioning possibilities are:
1. {1, 2, 3}
2. {1}, {2, 3}
3. {1, 2}, {3}
4. {1, 3}, {2}
5. {1}, {2}, {3}

So, there are 5 different ways to partition this set.
This means that the Bell number for n = 3 is 5.

4:
Composite Numbers:

Description:
Composite numbers are numbers that have more than two positive divisors: 
1, themselves, and at least one additional divisor.
They are the opposite of prime numbers.

Mathematics:
An integer n > 1 is composite if it is not prime.
This means there exist positive integers a and b (both greater than 1),
such that n = a * b.
So, a composite number has at least one pair of divisors,
that is not 1 and the number itself.

Example:
Consider the number 4. It has the divisors 1, 2, and 4.
Since 2 is a divisor of 4 and 2 is neither 1 nor 4, 4 is a composite number.
Another example is 9, which has the divisors 1, 3, and 9.
Since 3 is a divisor of 9 and 3 is neither 1 nor 9,
9 is also a composite number.
---
5:
Deficient Numbers:

Description:
Deficient numbers are numbers where the sum of their proper divisors 
(all positive divisors other than themselves) is less than the number itself.

Mathematics:
Let s(n) be the sum of the proper divisors of a number n.
A number n is deficient if s(n) < n.

Example:
Consider the number 10. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 5.
The sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.
Since 8 is less than 10, 10 is a deficient number.
Another example is the number 3. Its only proper divisor is 1,
and since 1 is less than 3, 3 is also a deficient number.

6:
Factorial Numbers:

Description:
A factorial number is the product of all positive integers
up to a given number n.
It is denoted as n! and is called n factorial.

Mathematics:
The factorial of a number n is denoted as n! and is the product of all positive
integers from 1 to n. Mathematically expressed:
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * .... * 3 * 2 * 1

By convention, we define 0! = 1.

Example:
Consider the number 4. Its factorial is 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.
Another example is the number 5.
Its factorial is 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
This means that 24 and 120 are factorial numbers.
---
7:
Fibonacci Numbers:

Description:
Fibonacci numbers are a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

Mathematics:
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

für alle n > 1.

Example:
The first ten numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
If we consider the number 5 in this sequence, 
it is derived from the sum of the two preceding numbers: 2 and 3.
The same applies to the number 21, which is the sum of 8 and 13.

8:
Happy Numbers:

Description:
Happy numbers are numbers that possess a certain property:
If you repeatedly sum the squares of their digits,
until you arrive at a single number, you eventually reach the number 1.

Mathematics:
To determine if a number n is happy:
1. Square each digit of the number.
2. Sum these squares to obtain a new number.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with the new number.

If you eventually reach the number 1, then n is a happy number.
If you enter into an endless loop that doesn't end at 1,
e.g., the loop 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4,
then the number is not happy.

Example:
Consider the number 19:
1^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 81 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 64 + 4 = 68 
6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 
 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1 

Since we eventually reach the number 1, 19 is a happy number.

9:
Harshad Numbers:

Description:
A Harshad number or Niven number is a positive integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

Mathematics:
Let n be a positive integer and s(n) be the sum of the digits of n.
n is a Harshad number if n is divisible by s(n) with no remainder.

Example:
Consider the number 18:
The sum of its digits is 1 + 8 = 9.
Since 18 is divisible by 9 with no remainder 18 / 9 = 2, 18 is a Harshad number.
Another example is the number 20.
The sum of its digits is 2 + 0 = 2. Since 20 is divisible by 2 with no remainder
20 / 2 = 10, 20 is also a Harshad number.
---
10:
Narcissistic Numbers:

Description:
A narcissistic number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits
, each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

Mathematics:
An n-digit number is narcissistic if the sum of its digits, 
each raised to the n-th power, is equal to the original number.

Mathematically expressed, let n be a d-digit number and a_i its digits.
n is narcissistic if:

n = (a_1)^d + (a_2)^d + ...+ (a_d)^d

Example:
Consider the number 153:
It is a 3-digit number. The sum of its digits, each raised to the third power, is:
	1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
Since this sum is equal to the original number 153, 153 is a narcissistic number.
Another example is the number 9474. It is a 4-digit number, and:
	9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474
Since this sum is equal to 9474, 9474 is also a narcissistic number.

11:
Perfect Numbers:

Description:
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors
i.e., all positive divisors other than itself.

Mathematics:
Let n be a positive integer. If the sum of the proper divisors of n including 1 but not n itself equals n,
then n is a perfect number.

Example:
Consider the number 28:
Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.
The sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

Since the sum of its proper divisors equals exactly 28, 28 is a perfect number.
Another well-known example of a perfect number is 6,
since the divisors of 6 other than 6 itself are 1, 2, and 3, and their sum 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
---
12:
Prime Numbers:

Description:
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1, 
which has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Mathematics:
A number n is a prime number if it is divisible only by 1 and n with no remainder.
This means that n has no proper divisors other than 1.

Example:
Consider the number 5:
The only numbers that divide 5 without a remainder are 1 and 5 itself.

This means that 5 is a prime number.
It's important to note that 2 is the only even prime number.
All other even numbers can be divided by 2 and are therefore not prime numbers.

13:
Sexy Prime Numbers:

Description:
A pair of prime numbers is referred to as "Sexy Primes" when they are exactly six units apart.
The term "sexy" comes from the Latin word "sex," which means six.

Mathematics:
If p and p+6 are both prime numbers, then p and p+6 form a "Sexy Prime" pair.

Example:
Consider the numbers 5 and 11:
Both are prime numbers and are exactly 6 units apart.

This means that (5, 11) is a "Sexy Prime" pair.
Another example is the pair (7, 13).
Both numbers are prime numbers and are 6 units apart, making them another "Sexy Prime" pair.
---
14:
Smith Numbers:

Description:
A Smith number is a composite number (i.e., not a prime number),
for which the sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the digits of its prime factors.
Here, the prime factors are counted as numbers, not as products.

Mathematics:
A number n is a Smith number if:
1. n is composite (not prime).
2. The sum of the digits of n is equal to the sum of the digits of all its prime factors.

Example:
Consider the number 22:
The prime factors of 22 are 2 and 11.  
Sum of the digits of 22: 2 + 2 = 4.  
Sum of the digits of the prime factors: 2 + (1 + 1) = 4.  

Since both sums are identical and 22 is composite, 22 is a Smith number.
---
15:
Square Numbers:

Description:
A square number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself.
This means that a number is square if it represents the square area of a square with an integer side length.

Mathematics:
A number n is a square number if there exists an integer x such that n = x^2.

Example:
Consider the number 121:
Since 11 * 11 = 121, 121 is a square number.
---
16:
Triangle Numbers:

Description:
A triangular number is a number that forms the shape of an equilateral triangle when arranged as points or objects.
It represents the number of points in a triangle with a given number of rows.

Mathematics:
The n_th triangular number is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The formula for finding the n_th triangular number is:
T_n = n(n+1) /2

Example:
Consider n = 4:
The triangular number is T_4 = 4(4+1) / 2 => 4 * 5 / 2 = 10. 

If you arrange 10 points in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with 1 point in the first row, 2 in the second, 3 in the third, and 4 in the fourth, you get a total of 10 points.
